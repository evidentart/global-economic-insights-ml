# Global Economic Insights: Unemployment and GDP Analysis with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project examines how indicators in the global economy affect unemployment patterns across nations. It utilizes historic unemployment data from across the globe and econonimic data (GDP) from multiple years. After aggregating data, the project analyzes relationships between GDP and levels of employment to identify economic trends. Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling are performed to extract trends and insights from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset combines:
- **Global unemployment data** by sex, age group, and age categories across countries.
- **GDP data** by country and year.  

**Scope:** Analysis is restricted to years **2020–2024**, where both GDP and unemployment values exist.

## Key Objectives
1. Explore the relationship between GDP and unemployment rates across countries.
2. Investigate trends in unemployment by age group and sex.
3. Identify unusual patterns or extreme values, such as high youth unemployment.
4. Build predictive models using polynomial features and Ridge regression to forecast unemployment rates.


## Future Work
- Incorporate additional economic indicators such as inflation, government spending, or labor participation rates.
- Build separate models for Youth and Adult unemployment to improve predictive accuracy.
- Visualize temporal and regional trends with interactive dashboards.
